# Hi everyone I want to introduce myself 😊

My name is Raghad 
I'm Cs student at Imam Muhammad ibn Saud University , my decision to pursue computer science stems from my deep passion for technology and a desire to understand its inner workings. In this field, I find the opportunity to transform ideas into innovative solutions that truly make a difference in our daily lives. It also allows me to develop critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills, empowering me to contribute to the advancement of our digital society.

I love computer science and I hope to benefit society with what I’ve learned in the future 😍 .
